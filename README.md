# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity


In this assignment, an interactive dashboard is created to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

Used Plot.ly, D3.js, Java Script and HTML



Used the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Used `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

* Used `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

* Used `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.



Created a bubble chart to display each sample.

* Used `otu_ids` for the x values.

* Used `sample_values` for the y values.

* Used `sample_values` for the marker size.

* Used `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

* Used `otu_labels` for the text values.



Sample metadata of an individual's demographic information is displayed.
